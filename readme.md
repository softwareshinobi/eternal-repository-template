## About This Repository

From My Universe To Yours, With Lots Of Love.

In order to receive we must share.

Or something like that.

In this repository and the repositories that shall extend this repository, I have shared many things.

The contents of these repositories have been created to fulfill a singular Intention.

## The Singular Intention

It is my Intention that the fruits of my software development labor will be shared with and consumed by the Universe, forever and forever.

I wish to become eternal.

Namaste.

## About The Author

I'll put something witty and clever here later.

## Read The Project Documentation

I put together a collection of content that goes into more detail about this project.

So go read that project documentation. Or don't, that's ok too.

Somewhere in there is RTFM humor.
