## In The Beginning

In the beginning, there was a GitHub repository that would supercede them all.

This is that GitHub project. And there are others.

This repository was created to be cloned/extended/forked/exploited/users by me, others, and the Universe to support their mission goals and intentions.

In this repository will find a generic source code repository template with baked-in capability for jenkins pipelines, automated builds, automated DockerHub deploys, and self-contained documentation.

## The True Intention Of This Repository

From My Universe To Yours, With Lots Of Love.

In order to receive we must share. Or something like that.

In this repository and the repositories that shall extend this repository, I have shared many things.

In addition to my duty to share, the contents of these repositories have been created to fulfill a selfish Intention.

## The Selfish Intention Of This Repository

It is my Intention that the fruits of my software development creation will be shared with and consumed by the Universe, today and forever and forever.

I desire that my fruit become eternal.

I desire to become Eternal.

--

With Lots Of Love,

Software Shinobi


## Read The Repository Documentation

I put together a collection of content that goes into more detail about this repository.

So go read that repository documentation. Or don't, that's ok too.

Somewhere in there is RTFM humor.

## Namaste.
